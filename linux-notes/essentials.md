# Linux for Robotics — Unit 2: Linux Essentials

## What I Learned
- Navigating the filesystem with `cd`, `pwd`, and `ls`.
- Understanding absolute (`/home/user/...`) vs relative paths (`../`, `~`).
- Creating, copying, moving, and deleting files/folders with `mkdir`, `touch`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`.
- Editing files with `vi`, including switching modes and saving/exiting.
- Running Python scripts to control the BB8 robot:
  - `python bb8_keyboard.py` → control robot with keyboard.
  - `python move_bb8_circle.py` → move in circles.
  - `python move_bb8_forward_backward.py` → move forward/backward.
- Introduction to hidden files (`.bashrc`) and using `ls -la`.
- Learned that permissions may block execution, which will be covered in Unit 3.

## Exercises Completed
- Found and executed BB8 control scripts.
- Created `my_scripts/move_bb8_square.py`.
- Fixed errors by moving files with `mv`.
- Practiced copying and removing files/folders.
- Confirmed why execution permissions matter (next unit).

## Notes
This unit was hands-on and used the BB8 robot in simulation to reinforce Linux commands.  
It also prepared me for the **final course project on TurtleBot3** in the Real Robot Labs.
