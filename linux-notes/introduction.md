# Linux for Robotics — Unit 1: Introduction

## Why Linux for Robotics?
- ROS currently only supports Linux.
- Linux powers most servers, supercomputers, Android devices, smart TVs, and embedded systems.
- Open source under GNU GPL → free to use and community-driven.
- Known for its versatility and security.

## Demo 1.1: Bash Script with BB-8
- Navigated to script folder:
cd /home/simulations/public_sim_ws/src/all/ros_basics_examples/linux_demo/
- Executed script with arguments:
- `./demo.sh forward` → BB8 moves forward
- `./demo.sh rotate` → BB8 rotates
- `./demo.sh stop` → BB8 stops
- Important: use `Ctrl + C` in the shell to stop the script.

## What This Course Will Teach
- Navigate and interact with Linux filesystem.
- Edit files using the Shell (vi editor).
- Manage file permissions.
- Create Bash scripts.
- Manage processes.
- Connect to remote computers with SSH.

## Real Robot
- Final project will be done on **TurtleBot3** in the Real Robot Labs.
- Certificate requires ≥8/10 grade and completion of real robot project.
