# ROS2Sandbox

Public experiments while I learn **Linux for Robotics**, **Python 3 for Robotics**, and **ROS 2 Basics in 5days** on The Construct.

## Folders (to be added soon)
- `linux-notes/` — commands & cheatsheets
- `python-robotics/` — Python practice
- `ros2-basics/` — ROS 2 starter packages
- `colcon_ws/src/` — ROS 2 workspace for building

*(Work in progress - I will keep pushing updates as i learn.)*
